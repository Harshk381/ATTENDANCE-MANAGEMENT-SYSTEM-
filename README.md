PROJECT DESCRIPTION

•	PROBLEM DEFINITION: 
This system developed will reduce the manual work and avoid redundant data. By maintaining the attendance manually, the then efficient reports cannot be generated. The system can generate efficient weekly, consolidate reports based on attendance. As the attendances are maintained in registers it has been a tough task for admin and staff to maintain for a long time. Instead, the software can keep long and retrieve the information when needed. 

•	PROJECT OVERVIEW 
This Attendance Management System basically has two main modules for proper functioning: - Admin module is having rights for updating, modifying any class of faculty for student details. 
The faculty has the right of making daily attendance, generating the report. Attendance report can be taken by given details of student details, date, class. 
 
•	MODULE DESCRIPTION 
The system should be designed in such a way that only authorized people should be allowed to access some particular modules. The records should be modified by only the faculty and no one else. The user should always be in control of the application and not vice versa. The user interface should be consistent so that the user can handle the application with ease and speed. The application should be visually, conceptually clear. The project Starts as follows below. 

•	MASTER PAGE 
The project starts from the main page, but before going to the project directly there is one page called Master Page. The Master page is interactive and more responsive, It Consists of the institute's logo which will expand to ALL INDIA SHRI SHIVAJI MEMORIAL SOCIETY COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, PUNE when hovering with the cursor. Then followed by the Topic i.e., DBMS-MINI-PROJECT. Then the Display of Crew Members description with the help of our profile pictures, which will rotate over the x-axis & y-axis, both at 180° degrees.

Easy implementation Environment 
Generate report Flexibly 

•	SCOPE FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT 
The project has a very vast scope in the future. The project can be implemented on the intranet in the future. The project can be updated shortly as and when the requirement for the same arises, assertively flexible in terms of expansion. With the proposed software of database Space Manager ready and fully functional, the client is now able to manage and hence run the entire work in a much better, accurate, and error-free manner. The following are the future scope for the project. 
Discontinue of particular student eliminate potential attendance. 
Barcode Reader-based attendance system.
